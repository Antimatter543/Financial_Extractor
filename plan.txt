I'm gonna word everything into my own words because I want to actually properly do this.

It's sunday 11PM.
I have 5 (really, 4 days) to do this.

>>> We need to extract key metrics like revenue, net income, ....
>>> And generate a SUMMARY REPORT highlighting theh elath of the company.


///// WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE BY THE END OF IT (deliverables)
===> So we need the code (scripts & explore ipynb?) 
===> The metrics in a csv,
===> A summary report for 2-3 financial statements? (we only have one financial statement?)
	=> I guess we'll be given others; im sure we can also just grab some online from the same place
===> A report describing approach, challenges faced, solutions implemeneted? (Would just documentation be enough? Like explore.ipynb thing?)

===> README md with instructions on running soluiton



WE ARE EVALUATED ON:
- if it's correct lol
- if we did deliverables
- Code quality (I guess don't put random stuff everywhere)
- Scalability -- did we consider how to scale etc? RAG RAG RAG

Submit w/ GITHUB REPO
Organise!



SOOOOOO OKAY now our things we have to do:


1) Extract the data (easy, pdfplumber we've already done)
2) Data preprocessing -- clean it up (no headers footers page numbers; segment well; validate somehow (check sums are correct?))
3) GENAI model -- idk huggingface API or something, just shove the pandas df from ^^^ into it, give some context, anaylse.
	==> 

4) Generate a summary report that includes 
	Key financial metrics (revenue, net income blah)
	Notable Trends or observations
	Short summary in normal (well, natural financial) language ig 

5) Discuss/implemnent scaling stragies for model, for a ton of fianncial statements: RAG? RAG RAG RAG? But also what other ways I wonder


We have 4 days to do this :::: Monday: 
Tidy up
