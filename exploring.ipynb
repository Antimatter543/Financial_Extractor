Net income was $529,000.\"\\n\\nFirst, I should identify the key financial figures here. There\\'s total revenue, which is $7,797,000. Then there are expenses, $7,268,000. After that, net income, which is $529,000.\\n\\nI\\'ll need to present this in a table with columns like Total Revenue, Expenses, and Net Income. So the structure would be:\\n\\n| Item      | Amount   |\\n|-----------|---------|\\n| Total Revenue | $7,797,000 |\\n| Expenses  | $7,268,000 |\\n| Net Income | $529,000 |\\n\\nWait, does that cover all the points? I think so. The user probably wants a clear and concise table with each item listed under its respective amount.\\n\\nLet me double-check if there are any other figures in the text. No, it seems to only mention revenue, expenses, and net income.
